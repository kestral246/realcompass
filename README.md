Real Compass
============

**compass** *(n)* A mechanical or electronic instrument used for navigation or orienteering,
which points to the physical or magnetic north pole.

This is a fork of compassgps (and compass), with 90% of the code removed.

Features
--------
This mod tries to address what the "real" essence of being a compass is all about.

No options, no gui's, just an animated needle that points toward the north.

I'm now using compass textures derived from the wonderful ones created by tacotexmex for ccompass.
I changed the colors and crafting recipe so that it can hopefully be used in parallel with ccompass,
since they both provide different features.

**NEW:** I have returned to using 16 pointing directions. *(I started with tacotexmex's 16-direction update for ccompass, but I changed the colors and slightly shortened most of the compass needles.)*

This mod is basically compassgps with 90% of its code ripped out, so I can't take much credit.
That belongs to Echo, PilzAdams, TeTpaAka, and Kilarin.  I was just standing on their shoulders.
